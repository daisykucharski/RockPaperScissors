# Rock Paper Scissors
## Description
This is a basic web-based game of rock, paper, scissors developed as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The purpose of this project was to learn about basic JavaScript concepts, such as random number generating and conditional logic. I decided to expand the project by adding a GUI and styling it with CSS. Through this, I learned about DOM manipulation and callback functions. I also practiced designing a website from scratch, since my previous HTML/CSS experience was in creating a website given an idea of what it should look like.

## Usage
To run it locally, just load index.html or check it out at https://daisykucharski.github.io/RockPaperScissors/.

## Future Expansion
I have expanded this project as far as I think that I am likely to. However, if I return to this project I would like to practice responsive design by making the website mobile-friendly.
